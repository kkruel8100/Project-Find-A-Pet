# Project-Find-A-Pet

Find-A-Pet is a website that seeks to reunite families with lost pets.  It has two components:
 
## First Component

Searches the Petfind API for dogs or cats in shelters and returns matches based on user provided criteria.  The user can then input the shelter id where the animal is located and get address information.

## Second Component

Searches the website database for dogs or cats and returns matches based on user provided criteria.  If a user has either lost or found a pet but can't find a match, they can post their own listing and upload a photograph of the pet and specify whether they are posting a lost or found listing.

## Technology

1. SASS for css styling.
2. Two APIs - Petfinder.com and Google maps
3. Firebase for database storage
